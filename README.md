<h1>Certified Wireless Technology Specialist (CWTS)</h1>

<p>The Certified Wireless Technology Specialist (CWTS) is an individual who can install APs based on a design document, configure the AP for initial operations and ensure connectivity. The individual can troubleshoot basic problems and assist users in-person or through remote communications in problem resolution. The ability to configure a WLAN client for connectivity is paramount with an understanding of the configuration process for SSIDs, security settings and other client adapter settings.</p>

<p>This individual is not responsible for WLAN design, analysis or security design; however, the CWTS should be able to gather information from a design specification document to properly configure an AP and troubleshoot individual connection issues. The CWTS may not be aware of the actual WLAN architectural design, the RF design or the full feature set in use to implement the WLAN.</p>

<h1>Becoming a CWTS:</h1>

<p>The CWTS certification is an entry-level WLAN certification from the vendor-neutral CWNP organization that brought you CWNA and other advanced certifications. To earn the CWTS certification, you must pass an online exam with a score of 70% or higher. Those desiring to work as instructors teaching CWTS classes must pass with a score of 80% or higher. Regardless of the way you choose to prepare for the CWTS exam, you should start with the exam objectives, which cover the full list of knowledge tested on the exam. The CWTS is a three-year certification, and it is renewed by passing the most recent version of the CWTS exam again.</p>
